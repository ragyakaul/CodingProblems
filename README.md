# CodingProblems

This is a list of small coding problems, most of which I got from Leetcode. I'm following this page (https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/) 
separating the problems into sections like 'Arrays 101', 'Recursion', with the aim of trying out numerous problems using each important data structure and algorithm.
I believe by the end of this I will get a good grasp of coding and be proud of my coding skills. My aim is to finish these ~17 topics, completing 100% of the progress in each. 

Edit 26/7/22: I solved a bunch of problems but forgot to upload them onto Github. Hence I just installed the Chrome extension 'LeetHub' which automatically updates your Github as soon as you finish a problem! I love technology! #StraightOuttaCompsci

Edit 18/7/24: Hey there! It's amazing seeing the attempts I made with Leetcode prior to having industry experience! With my current experience, I have decided to continue this quest, although my approach will be slightly modified. I will no longer be completing each section in the image below, Leetcode released an "Interview Crash Course" which covers all the below concepts in a much more concise way, so I will be completing that. My second change is going to be changing to solving these C#. C# is a language I am currently studying very deeply and is now my strongest language. I believe a strong foundational knowledge of C# will be the best way to tackle these and get most out of it. I also recognize the complexity that entails C++ may have made Leetcode much harder for me than in needs to be in the past.
