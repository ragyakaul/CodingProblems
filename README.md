# CodingProblems

This is a list of small coding problems, most of which I got from Leetcode. I'm following this page (https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/) 
separating the problems into sections like 'Arrays 101', 'Recursion', with the aim of trying out numerous problems using each important data structure and algorithm.
I believe by the end of this I will get a good grasp of coding and be proud of my coding skills. My aim is to finish these ~17 topics, completing 100% of the progress in each. 

Note: After solving a few problems, I started using MS Paint to draw out my approach. These design docs are with the extension ".png"

Edit 26/7/22: I solved a bunch of problems but forgot to upload them onto Github. Hence I just installed the Chrome extension 'LeetHub' which automatically updates your Github as soon as you finish a problem! I love technology! #StraightOuttaCompsci
