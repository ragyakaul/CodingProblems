# CodingProblems

This is a list of small coding problems, most of which I got from Leetcode. I'm following this page (https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/) 
separating the problems into sections like 'Arrays 101', 'Recursion', with the aim of trying out numerous problems using each important data structure and algorithm.
I believe by the end of this I will get a good grasp of coding and be proud of my coding skills.
